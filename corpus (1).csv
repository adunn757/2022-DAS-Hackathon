1,Dog Document,"The dog or domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dogs nearest living relative."
2,Another Dog Document,"The origin of the domestic dog includes the dogs genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and the emergence of the first dogs. Genetic studies show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf population – or closely related wolf populations – which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.[3][4] The dogs similarity to the extant grey wolf is the result of substantial dog-into-wolf gene flow,[3] with the modern grey wolf being the dogs nearest living relative.[5] An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog."
3,Nuclear Document,"Nuclear fission is a reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei. The fission process often produces gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay."
